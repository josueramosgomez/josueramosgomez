ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @josueramosgomez

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data analysis, Machine learning, Deep learning, AI, NLP etc.

I have used in this project TF-IDF with lineal model and also with bayesian model. I have obtained a 0.80049 in the leaderboard which is not bad. The last thing which I will do in this competition is to try with RNN (Recurrent Neuronal Network) trough transformers. hopefully I can reach close to 0.85.

You can have a look to the whole code below:

ðŸ’¥ðŸš— The last proyect I was working was a very interesting Data project to predict harmfulness of vehicles' accidents in Madrid starting from general data of the accident context. Have a look at it!

ðŸŒ¿ ALL projects that are/will be uploaded are personal ones and self coded.
