At the moment I am working on an NLP kaggle competition to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. I have used in this project TF-IDF with lineal model and also with bayesian model. I have obtained a 0.80049 in the leaderboard which is not bad. The last thing which I will do in this competition is to try with RNN (Recurrent Neuronal Network) trough transformers. hopefully I can reach close to 0.85

💥🚗 The last proyect I was working was very interesting Data project to predict harmfulness of vehicles' accidents in Madrid starting from general data of the accident context. Have a look at it!
